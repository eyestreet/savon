About the eyestreet/savon fork:

This fork is very specific to connecting to the IPAWS OPEN 2.0 server.  All I did was take the carnesmedia/savon fork and modify it to fit my needs.

If you need to do WS-Security, more than likely you will not want to use this fork.  I recommend using the carnesmedia/savon fork and modifying that to fit your needs.

About the carnesmedia/savon branch
----------------------------------

This branch includes a working, but possibly app specific, implementation of WSSESecurity.

To enable the feature, do something like this:

    Savon::Client.new do |wsdl, http, wsse|
      certs = Savon::WSSE::Certs.new :cert_file => "certs/cert_key.pem", :private_key_file => "certs/cert_key.pem", :private_key_password => "a super secret password"
      wsse.sign_with = Savon::WSSE::Signature.new certs
      ...
    end

You'll also need to edit lib/savon/wsse/canonicalizer.rb and add any namespace your documents will have to the <XPath> attributes.

Here's an enumeration of the changes:

### Savon::SOAP::Request

* Process Savon::WSSE::Signature when needed.

### Savon::SOAP::XML

* Changed default env_namespace to soapenv (specific to my application)
* Use WSSE#signature? configuration
* Ability to regenerate (bypassing cached xml)
* Include Savon::WSSE::Signature#body_attributes when signing (through Savon::WSSE)

### Savon::WSSE

* Add #sign_with=/#signature? configuration
* Generate signature xml header when signing
* Include other header attributes even when generating a signature, timestamp, or user_token

### Savon::WSSE::Canonicalizer

* Very *hacky* proxy for xml canonicalization.
* Uses XMLStarlet (http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/) via the command line, which must be installed seperately.
* Other XMLStarlet alternatives:
 * XMLCanonicalizer (http://rubygems.org/gems/XMLCanonicalizer): DID NOT WORK FOR ME!
 * Nokogiri: For status of c14n support see discussion at https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/issues#issue/226
 * Unofficial fork of libxml-ruby (http://rubygems.org/gems/coupa-libxml-ruby): I haven't tried it yet...

WARNING: This implementation has a bunch of hard-coded xml namespaces, you'll have to add your own.
         Please read the many other comments in lib/savon/wsse/canonicalization.rb.

### Savon::WSSE::Certs
* A class for managing certificates for signing with Savon::WSSE::Signature

### Savon::WSSE::Signature
* Signs soap requests by:
 * adding a wsu:Timestamp
 * digesting the timestamp and the body
 * digitally signing said digests with an X509 certificate
* Requires three passes in order to canonicalize and digest generated sections. (see Savon::SOAP::XML#setup)

### Savon::WSSE::VerifySignature
* Reads a signed soap request/response and attempts to verify the signature
* This class can be used to verify incomming responses, as well as to verify requests generated by Savon::WSSE::Signature for testing.




Installation
------------

Savon is available through [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/gems/savon) and can be installed via:

    $ gem install savon

Basic workflow
--------------

    # Setting up a Savon::Client representing a SOAP service.
    client = Savon::Client.new do
      wsdl.document = "http://service.example.com?wsdl"
    end

    client.wsdl.soap_actions
    # => [:create_user, :get_user, :get_all_users]

    # Executing a SOAP request to call a "getUser" action.
    response = client.request :get_user do
      soap.body = { :id => 1 }
    end

    response.to_hash
    # => { :get_user_response => { :first_name => "The", :last_name => "Hoff" } }
